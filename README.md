Mainstage Scripts
=================

This is a repository for scripts I've created for the Mainstage 3 MIDI Scripter.

Currently there's only one script: a harp gliss trigger script that will play a gliss with a single keypress. To install, download the .pst file and place it in `Music/Audio Music Apps/Plug-In Settings/Scripter` in your home directory.

I'll post more detailed directions soon, but in the meantime look at [Matthew J. Pool's plugin directions](http://www.matthewjpool.com/harp-glissandi-in-mainstage/).
